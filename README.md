# miniRT
An accelerated mini raytracer for 42 and the 42 world

The main objective of this work was to implement a whitted style raytracer.  
Regarding the other miniRT that you could find on github this work originality and **main contribution** is the implementation of an accelerated three structure **(namely :BVH)**.  
Thus the rendering should be way faster than any other miniRT (so far)   
# Features
    whitted style raytracing
    Multi-thread
    BVH-acceleration
    super-sampling
    Blin-Phong lighting
    Reflection

# Requirements for Linux

    MinilibX only support TrueColor visual type (8,15,16,24 or 32 bits depth)
    gcc
    make
    X11 include files (package xorg)
    XShm extension must be present (package libxext-dev)
    Utility functions from BSD systems - development files (package libbsd-dev)
    e.g. sudo apt-get install gcc make xorg libxext-dev libbsd-dev (Debian/Ubuntu)

# usage
    ./miniRT (.rt file) [skymap directory] [--save]
    exemples:
        ./miniRT scenes/reflexion.rt skymaps/creek/
        -- will display the scene reflection.rt whiht the skymap creek
      
        ./miniRT scenes/dragon2.rt skymaps/darkness/ --save
        -- will display the scene dragon2.rt whiht the skymap darkness and save the result to image

        ./miniRT scenes/onlycat.rt
        -- whill display the scene onlycat.rt
